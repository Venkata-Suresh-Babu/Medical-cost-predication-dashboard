Medical cost predication analysis

I built and analyzed a Medical Cost Prediction Dashboard to uncover how demographics, diseases, and insurance types drive healthcare costs. Here’s the story the data told me 👇
Insights derived from my Power BI dashboard

🔹 1. **Gender & BMI: Small Differences, Big Signals**

Females slightly outnumber males (50.38% vs 49.62%), yet average max BMI is higher for females (40.67) than males (40.21).

The largest BMI gap appears in the 20–30 age group, where females exceed males by 3.1 BMI points.

Among seniors (70+), females make up 7.7% of the maximum BMI distribution, highlighting higher obesity risk in later years.

📌 Insight: Early adulthood is a critical intervention window, especially for women, before risks compound with age.

🔹 2. **Heart Disease: Costly, Gender-Skewed, and Predictable**

Total heart disease patients: 711, with males accounting for 51.05%.

Average medical cost for heart disease patients is ~$10.16K, compared to ~$7.7K for non-heart disease cases.

Interestingly, avg cost of heart disease and non-heart disease are negatively correlated, indicating distinct cost drivers.

📌 Insight: Preventive care targeting male populations could significantly reduce long-term healthcare expenditure.

🔹 3. **Age, Asthma & Hypertension: A Compounding Effect**

The 70+ age group dominates asthma cases, with 656% more patients than ages 18–20.

Asthma and hypertension show a strong positive correlation, especially in older populations.

Hypertension exceeds asthma most sharply in the 70+ group, by 262 patients.

Asthma patients incur higher costs:

With asthma: $9,020 avg cost

Without asthma: $7,991 avg cost

📌 Insight: Chronic conditions don’t act alone — they stack, amplifying both risk and cost.

🔹 4. **Insurance Type: The Hidden Cost Multiplier**

Uninsured (“None”) patients drive nearly 50% of total medical costs (~$20M).

Avg medical cost by insurance:

None: $19.1K

Government: $6.8K

Private: $3.4K

At younger ages, uninsured patients show up to 457% higher avg costs than privately insured.

Smoking rates remain similar across insurance types, but privately insured heart-disease patients show the largest smoker gap.

📌 Insight: Lack of insurance isn’t just a social issue — it’s a financial risk amplifier for the entire healthcare system.
